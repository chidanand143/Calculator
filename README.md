Simple Python Calculator
A sleek and powerful command-line calculator app built with Python. This tool makes complex calculations simple and quick, right from your terminal. 

üöÄ Key Features
 * Effortless Calculations: Perform all your basic math‚Äîaddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division‚Äîin a single line. Just type your equation and get the answer instantly.
 * Intuitive Interface: The app runs continuously, waiting for your next calculation. No need to re-run the script every time. When you're done, a simple quit command shuts it down.
 * Built to Last: Our robust error handling ensures the app won't crash from a simple mistake like a typo or trying to divide by zero. It gives you a clear, friendly message instead.
 * Lightweight & Fast: This calculator is a lean, mean, calculating machine, designed for speed and efficiency.
   
‚ñ∂ How to Get Started
 * Save the Code: Save the Python script as a file, for example, calc.py.
 * Run from Your Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to where you saved the file, and run.
 * Calculate! Enter your equation, like 15 * 3, and hit Enter. The result will appear on the next line.

üë©‚Äçüíª The Code Behind It
The magic happens with a continuous loop and Python's built-in eval() function, which safely interprets your math equations. A try...except block acts as a safety net, catching any errors before they can interrupt your flow. This is a perfect example of building a practical, user-focused application with minimal code.
